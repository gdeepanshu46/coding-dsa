Transaction :

A transaction is a single logical unit of work which accesses and possibly modifies the contents of a database. Transactions access data using read and write operations.
In order to maintain consistency in a database, before and after the transaction, certain properties are followed. These are called ACID properties.

1. Atomicity : The entire transaction takes place or doesn't happens at all. Only two operations, either ABORT() OR COMMIT()

2. Consistency : The database must be consistent before and after the transaction

3. Isolation : Multiple transactions occur independently without interference

4. Durability : The changes of a successful transaction occurs even if the system failure occurs

Transaction States :

BEGIN -> ACTIVE -> PARTIALLY COMMITTED -> COMMITTED 
  			|		|						  |
  			V		V						  V
   			----> FAILED -->  ABORT  --> TERMINATED
