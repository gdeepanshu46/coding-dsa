# Multithreading 
	It is a feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program
	for MAXIMUM utilization of CPU. Each part of the program is called a Thread
	So Threads are light-weight processes within a process.

# In simple terms - 
	1. A program in execution is known as a Process
	2. Divide the program in several small parts, each called a Thread
	3. Parallel execution of such threads Maximize the CPU utilization
